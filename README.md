### PROJECT DESIGNATION: THE UNDERWATER GAUNTLET

> **"Six levels. Infinite pressure. No escape."**

This project simulates the world's most impenetrable prison, strictly organizing the criminal underworld by bounty capability. From the rookie pirates in the sunlit upper floors to the legends erased from history in the depths, every inmate has a price on their head and a designated cell in the deep.

---

## CONFINEMENT PROTOCOLS

The facility is divided into six distinct levels. Inmates are sorted automatically based on the threat they pose to the World Government (Bounty).

| LEVEL | DESIGNATION | BOUNTY THRESHOLD | ENVIRONEMENT |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LVL 1** | **Crimson Hell** | 0 - 10,000,000 | A forest of sharp red leaves and grass that cut like knives. |
| **LVL 2** | **Beast Hell** | 10M - 30,000,000 | A floor filled with giant, hungry monsters that hunt the inmates. |
| **LVL 3** | **Starvation Hell** | 30M - 50,000,000 | A scorching, dry desert with no food or water. |
| **LVL 4** | **Blazing Hell** | 50M - 100,000,000 | A giant furnace of raging fire and boiling blood. |
| **LVL 5** | **Freezing Hell** | 100M - 300,000,000 | A frozen wasteland where prisoners are entombed in ice. |
| **LVL 6** | **Eternal Hell** | 300,000,000+ | A secret void for criminals so dangerous they must be erased from history. |

## SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

The Warden Interface allows for complete control over the prison population.

*   **INTAKE PRISONER**
    *   **Auto-Assign:** Input the criminal's details and bounty. The system will calculate the threat level and assign the correct floor automatically.
    *   **Manual Override:** Manually force a prisoner into a specific level regardless of bounty.
*   **VIEW RECORD:** View the complete list of current prisoners across all floors.
*   **LOCATE & INTEL:** Search for specific prisoners to view their full criminal profile and location.
*   **STATUS UPDATE:** Modify prisoner records (bounty increases, alias changes).
*   **RELEASE:** Process the release or transfer of inmates.

## OPERATIONAL GUIDE

Follow these steps to initialize the prison management system.

### You may run the pre-compiled executable or compile the source code manually.

**Option A: Execute Pre-compiled Binary**
Navigate to the release folder and run the `.exe` file. The terminal interface will launch immediately.

**Option B: Compile from Source**
If you wish to modify the prison architecture, compile using a standard C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ impel_down.cpp -o impel_down.exe -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
./impel_down.exe
```

### 3. Interface Navigation
Upon system startup, use the numerical menu to execute commands:

1.  **Add Prisoner:** Triggers the intake protocol. Select Auto or Manual assignment.
2.  **View Manifest:** Displays formatted list of all incarcerated entities.
3.  **Search:** Query database by Name or ID.
4.  **Update/Release:** Manage existing records.
